(Author: Ravi Kishor Shakya)

1) Return all Title elements (of both departments and courses).
doc("courses.xml")/Course_Catalog/(Department/Title | Department/Course/Title)

2)Return last names of all department chairs.
doc("courses.xml")/Course_Catalog/Department/Chair/Professor/Last_Name

3)Return titles of courses with enrollment greater than 500.
doc("courses.xml")/Course_Catalog/Department/Course[@Enrollment > 500]/Title

4)Return titles of departments that have some course that takes "CS106B" as a prerequisite.
doc("courses.xml")/Course_Catalog/Department[Course/Prerequisites/Prereq = 'CS106B']/Title

5)Return last names of all professors or lecturers who use a middle initial. Don't worry about eliminating duplicates.
doc("courses.xml")//(Professor | Lecturer)[Middle_Initial]/Last_Name
